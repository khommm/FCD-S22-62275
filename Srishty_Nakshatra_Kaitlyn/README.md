The Diamond Parametric structure is located on the front lawn of CFA. The structure is meant to be a zone of relaxation and shade from the sunlight. During hot summer days, students may find themselves laying under the structure after a long day of stressful work. Though the structure provides vast amounts of shade, itâ€™s most appearant feature is spotlightof sunlight that shines through the structure. This spotlight is created by the open panels concentrated on the facade.

- `.gh` generates the space frame 
- `.3dm` CAD model file
- this `.md` README

## Instructions for Use

This project uses a _Grasshopper_ script&mdash; which is a file that contains the algorithm to generatively design our spaceframe. You must have Rhino X to open the `.3dm` file.

**Dependencies**

The _Grasshopper_ script uses:
  - Lunchbox
  - Ladybug
  - Pufferfish

Install these dependencies and then open the `.gh` file in Rhino3D.
